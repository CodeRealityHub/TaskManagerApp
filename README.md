⚙️ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd TaskMaster

2. Configure Firebase

Create/configure a Firebase project and add:

google-services.json

Place it inside:

app/google-services.json

Enable:

* Firebase Authentication
* Cloud Firestore

3. Build the Project

./gradlew build

4. Run on Android

./gradlew installDebug

Or open the project in Android Studio and run it on an emulator or physical Android device.

🔄 Data Flow

User Action → Compose UI → ViewModel → Repository → Firebase → Updated State → Compose UI

🔒 Security

* Firebase Authentication handles user authentication.
* Firestore security rules control database access.
* User-specific data can be protected through authenticated access.
* Firebase credentials/configuration are managed through the project configuration.

🌍 Real-World Use Case

TaskMaster can be used by:

* 👨‍💻 Software development teams
* 🎨 Design teams
* 📢 Marketing teams
* 🎓 Student project groups
* 🧑‍💼 Freelancers
* 🏢 Small businesses

A team can create a project, break it into tasks, assign responsibilities, update task statuses, and track overall project progress from one workspace.
